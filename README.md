## Overview

🍎 Based upon [A-Frame version 0.9](https://aframe.io/docs/0.9.0/introduction/).
  
🍎 Using [navigation mesh](https://www.donmccurdy.com/2017/08/20/creating-a-nav-mesh-for-a-webvr-scene/) based pathfinding.
  
🍎 Integrated with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for data visualization.
- Make examples. (TODO)
  
🍎 Enables easy use of shaders created with [Shader Frog](https://shaderfrog.com/).
- Include the desired shader json file in your build by importing in shader-frog.js
- Declaratively implement the shader-frog component in your HTML.

🍎 JS, CSS, and JSON bundling, minification, and uglifying with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en).

🍎 Installable as a Progressive Web App [(PWA)](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/).

🍎 **Stats visualization system** including:
- **RingDial** data visualization widget
- **Meter** data visualization widget
- **GUI Widgets** (TODO)

🍎 Collectibiles System
- Offline collection
- Online collection
- Collectibles can be set to respawn

🍎 Items can be declared **grabbable**, therefore movable by players.

🍎 **grabbable** items can be launched with the **launchable** component.

🍎 [A-Frame Effects](https://github.com/wizgrav/aframe-effects)
- bloom
- glitch
- godrays
- fxaa

🍎 [A-Frame Particle Player](https://github.com/supermedium/aframe-particleplayer-component)
- JSON particles bundling

🍎 BGM System (named exports)
- via SoundCloud
  - bgmlite: simple no UI, no server interaction
  - bgm: includes UI and interactive multiplayer interaction (TODO)

🍎 Player Component
- instantiated for all players
- avatars and animation clips can be changed dynamically

🍎 Node Graph Flow Based Editor
- Create with [Litegraph](https://github.com/jagenjo/litegraph.js). (<a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/cs1-flow?path=README.md:1:0" noopener noreferer>Early Development</a>)

🍎 Cloud Component
- vertex animation
- custom color

🍎 NPC Component

🍎 Dotrow Component
- Makes it easy to add rows of collectibles.
- Intended to be developer's first look in to editing component source code.

🍎 Database
- uses [Lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb) 

🍎 IoT Component
- Illustrates basic IoT device integration.
