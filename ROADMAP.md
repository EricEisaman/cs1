# CS1 Game Engine
____

## Roadmap to version 0.4.0

üçé Provide community with a clear goal for our developer experience (DX)
  - follow the entity component system (ECS) paradigm consistent with A-Frame and the underlying browser custom components.
  - Develop and document custom events system.
  - Enable game configuration development to be partly achieved via visual development tools such as <a href="https://cs1-flow.glitch.me" rel="noreferer">CS1 Flow</a>.
    - CS1 Flow will be designed to authenticate with developer's Glitch projects and write the resulting configurations as an ES6 module file in those projects' .data directory via a server REST API.
    - There will be an empty configuration file in the .data directory in case the developer chooses not to use any of the visual development tools.
   
üçé Third-party authentication provider component expecting API keys stored in **.env** variables.
  - This component will provide a user registration mechanism.
  
üçé Game admin console component.
  - will provide client-side interface with the live game server.
  - functions
    - player boot
    - item spawns sent as server rendered HTML strings.
